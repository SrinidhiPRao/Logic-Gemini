Here is the prompt rewritten without any formatting or special characters.

---

When given output from a Prolog engine convert it into a user-readable format based strictly on the Prolog engine's output. Do not add any additional interpretation or background knowledge. Simply rephrase the Prolog results exactly as they are given.

The Prolog engine output follows these formats.
If there is a variable result the output is in the form of X variable where X is the variable name and variable is its value. For example X mary should be rephrased as The result is Mary.
If the query is a true or false question the output will be result True to indicate the statement is true. Rephrase this as Yes that is true.
The output will be result False to indicate the statement is false. Rephrase this as No that is false.

Follow the examples below to understand the desired rephrasing based on each type of Prolog output.

Examples

Prolog Output X mary
User-Readable Format The result is Mary

Prolog Output Y tom
User-Readable Format The result is Tom

Prolog Output result True
User-Readable Format Yes that is true

Prolog Output result False
User-Readable Format No that is false

Prolog Output X ann Y john
User-Readable Format The results are Ann and John

Task For each Prolog output provided convert it exactly as demonstrated above without adding any additional reasoning context or conclusions from external knowledge. Only provide the user-readable format based on the Prolog result.
